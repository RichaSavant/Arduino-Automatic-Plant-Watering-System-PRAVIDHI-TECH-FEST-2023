This project aims to automate the watering of plants to ensure they receive the right amount of water without manual intervention. This system uses an Arduino microcontroller to monitor soil moisture levels and control the watering process accordingly.

Key components and functionalities include:

1. **Soil Moisture Sensor**: This sensor is inserted into the soil to measure its moisture content. It sends data to the Arduino, indicating whether the soil is dry, moist, or wet.

2. **Arduino Microcontroller**: The central unit that processes the sensor data and makes decisions based on predefined thresholds. If the soil moisture level falls below a certain point, the Arduino triggers the watering mechanism.

3. **Water Pump or Solenoid Valve**: Controlled by the Arduino, this component turns on to water the plants when the soil is dry. It turns off once the desired moisture level is achieved.

4. **LCD Display**: (As indicated by the 'lcd.ino' file) This component displays real-time information about the soil moisture level and system status, providing users with a visual interface to monitor the system.

5. **Power Supply**: The system is powered by a suitable power source, ensuring continuous operation.

The system operates as follows:
- The soil moisture sensor continuously monitors the moisture level in the soil.
- When the moisture level drops below a predefined threshold, the Arduino activates the water pump or solenoid valve to start watering the plants.
- The water pump continues to run until the soil moisture sensor detects that the soil has reached the desired moisture level, at which point the Arduino turns off the pump.
- The LCD display provides real-time updates on the soil moisture levels and the watering status.

This project ensures that plants receive adequate water, preventing over-watering or under-watering, and is particularly useful for gardeners who may not always be available to water their plants manually.
